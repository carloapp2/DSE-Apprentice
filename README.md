# DSE-Apprentice

Hey Team,

Thanks for your time yesterday, per our discussion I'd like to give you guys a small task to work together on... This means take your headphones off and discuss how you might tackle a predictive problem. No deadlines, but would like you guys on Watson Studio platform together to work on the project.

Please see Word Document on details of challenge and CSV file with data. I setup meeting for tomorrow to discuss.

In addition, i created a project in Watson Studio and added each of you to it.

Thanks,
Carlo
